# USDT Flash

A small static site that documents a step-by-step guide and includes a Solidity example for creating a USDT-like token using Remix.

Files of interest
- `usdt-flash.html` â€” main static HTML page with the guide, embedded video, and Solidity code.
- `main.js` â€” (if present) supporting JavaScript for the demo.

Quick start

1. Open `usdt-flash.html` in a browser (double-click or serve it via a simple static server).
2. Follow the instructions in the page to view the Solidity code and copy it to Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org).

Notes and warnings
- The Solidity contract included in the HTML is provided for educational/demo purposes only. Do not deploy contracts to mainnet unless you understand the code and security implications.
- This repository appears to be a static website and example code â€” treat any token/financial instructions with caution.
